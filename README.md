This is a simple 3D game prototype created in your browser.

## How to Run Locally

To play this game, you need to run it from a local web server on your computer. Follow these simple steps.

### 1. Make sure you have Python

Most computers already have Python installed. If not, you can download it for free from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. Navigate to the Game Folder

Open your computer's terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and use the `cd` command to go to the folder where you saved the game files (`index.html` and `game.js`).

For example:
```bash
cd path/to/the/game_folder
```

### 3. Start the Web Server

In the terminal, run the following command:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

You should see a message like `Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...`

### 4. Open the Game in Your Browser

Open your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) and go to this address:

[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

The game should now be running in your browser window! To look around, click and drag with your mouse or swipe on a touch screen.
